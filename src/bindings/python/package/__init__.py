# Python 3.8+ has stopped loading DLLs from PATH environment variable on Windows.

# This code reproduce the old behavior (loading DLLs from PATH) by doing the following:
# 1 - Tokenizing PATH
# 2 - Checking that the directories exist and are not "."
# 3 - Add them to the DLL load path.
#
# The behavior described above is opt-out which means that it is activated by default. 
# A user can opt-out and use the default behavior of Python 3.8+ by setting OCIO_PYTHON_LOAD_DLLS_FROM_PATH 
# environment variable to 0.
