.. py:class:: MixingSlider
   :module: PyOpenColorIO

   The :ref:`MixingSlider` and :ref:`MixingColorSpaceManager` classes are to help applications implement correct color pickers. The term "color mixing" is used here to describe what is done in a typical application "color picker" user interface.

   A user may want to mix colors in different color spaces. The two most common mixing space options are a scene-linear working space or the display space.

   Since scene-linear color spaces are not perceptually uniform, it is necessary to compensate UI widgets such as sliders. For example, it is nice if mid-gray falls near the center of mixing controls rather than way over near the black end. This may be done by using a mapping from linear into an approximately perceptually uniform space.

   Also note that a color picking/mixing UI may want to present a given color space in several different encodings. The most common two encodings for color mixing are RGB and HSV.

   Note that these helpers anticipate that a user may want to mix colors using values that extend outside the typical [0,1] domain.
