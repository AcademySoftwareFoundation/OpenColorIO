.. py:exception:: ExceptionMissingFile
   :module: PyOpenColorIO

   An exception class for errors detected at runtime.

   Thrown when OCIO cannot find a file that is expected to exist. This is provided as a custom type to distinguish cases where one wants to continue looking for missing files, but wants to properly fail for other error conditions.
