.. py:function:: GetLoggingLevel() -> PyOpenColorIO.LoggingLevel
   :module: PyOpenColorIO

   Get the global logging level.

   You can override this at runtime using the OCIO_LOGGING_LEVEL environment variable. The client application that sets this should use :ref:`SetLoggingLevel`, and not the environment variable. The default value is INFO.
