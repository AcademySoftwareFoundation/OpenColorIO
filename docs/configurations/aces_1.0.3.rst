Colorspaces
***********

Colorspaces in this configurations are grouped into the following families: 
ACES, ADX, Look, Output, Input, Utility, Aliases. Descriptions for the 
colorspaces in the different families are provided below.

For ease of use across a broader number of applications, the family name of each
colorspace is pre-pended to the colorspace name when the configuration is
authored. Those prefixes will be omitted in this document, but will show up when
the configuration is loaded and used.

ACES Colorspaces
----------------

- ACES2065-1
- ACEScc
- ACEScct
- ACESproxy
- ACEScg

**Description**

Colorspaces and transforms implementing the ACES Output Transforms. These 
colorspaces produce code values ready for display on hardware devices calibrated
to the standard used to name the colorspace.

**Technical information**

- Transforms generated based on the `ACES CTL Transforms <https://github.com/ampas/aces-dev/tree/v1.0.3/transforms/ctl>`_
- All transforms produce full-range output. Host applications should be used to
  apply an full-to-legal scaling needed.

Input Colorspaces
-----------------

There are a variety of Input Transforms covering different cameras manufacturers, gamuts, transfer functions and camera settings. See below for specifics.

**Description**

Colorspaces and transforms that implement the ACES Input Transforms. These colorspaces are used to convert from camera-specific formats and encodings to ACES.

**Technical information**

References and descriptions are provided for each group of Input Transforms below.

- The colorspaces whose names include a transfer function and a gamut name are full implementations of ACES Input Transforms.
	- Ex. The ARRI 'V3 LogC (EI160) - Wide Gamut' colorspace
	- Ex. The RED 'REDlogFilm - DRAGONcolor2' colorspace
	- Ex. The Canon 'Canon-Log - DCI-P3 Daylight' colorspace
- The colorspaces that start with 'Linear - ' will convert to or from a specific gamut but not apply a transfer function.
- The colorspaces that start with 'Curve - ' will apply a transfer function but not convert between gamuts.

ADX Colorspaces
'''''''''''''''

- ADX10
- ADX16

**Description**

Utility
-------

**Description**

A collection of colorspaces that are used to facilitate the creation of LUTs and other basic functionality.

**Technical information**

- The 'Log2 xx nits Shaper' and 'Dolby PQ xx nits Shaper' spaces cover the linear range centered around 18% grey. The 48 nits spaces cover -6.5 stops (0.0028125) to +6.5 stops(16.291740). The 1000 nits spaces cover -12 stops to +10 stops. The 2000 nits spaces cover -12 stops to +11 stops. The 4000 nits spaces cover -12 stops to +12 stops.
- The LMT shaper spaces cover the linear range going from 10 stops below 18% grey (0.00017578125) to 6.5 stops above 18% grey (16.291740)
- The colorspaces starting with 'Linear - ' will convert to or from a specific gamut but not apply a transfer function.
- The colorspaces starting with 'Curve - ' will apply a transfer function but not convert between gamuts.

Look
----

**Colorspaces**

- ACES 1.0 to 0.1 emulation
- ACES 1.0 to 0.2 emulation
- ACES 1.0 to 0.7 emulation

**Description**

Colorspaces and transforms emulating the look of the ACES 0.1, 0.2 and 0.7 release.

- Should be applied to data in the ACES2065-1 colorspace.
- Should be used before an ACES Output Transform.

**Technical information**

Transforms generated based on the `ACES CTL Transforms <https://github.com/ampas/aces-dev/tree/v1.0.3/transforms/ctl>`_

Roles
*****

**Description**

The role colorspaces are aliases to the colorspaces used for the *OCIO* 'roles' functionality.

**Aliases**

**Description**

The alias colorspaces are named with all lower-case letters and no spaces, dashes, parentheses or other characters that would not work well in a filename. They are only references, aliases for the base colorspaces with more user-friendly names. These spaces were added to enable OCIO's token-based colorspace / filename matching.

- These colorspaces should not generally be used by most artists.


Roles
-----

The standard *OCIO* roles are defined. They role assignments are:

- **color_picking**: Output - Rec.709
- **color_timing**: ACEScc
- **compositing_log**: ADX10
- **data**: Raw
- **default**: ACES2065-1
- **matte_paint**: ACEScc
- **reference**: Raw
- **scene_linear**: ACEScg
- **texture_paint**: Raw

Additionally, a number of colorspaces that are gaining wider adoption have been added to the config. Their names and assignment are:

- **compositing_linear**: ACEScg
- **rendering**: ACEScg


Displays and Views
******************

The default config has one Display named **ACES**, which contains the following Views / colorspaces:

- sRGB, colorspace: sRGB
- sRGB D60 sim., colorspace: sRGB (D60 sim.)
- DCDM, colorspace: DCDM
- DCDM P3 gamut clip, colorspace: DCDM (P3 gamut clip)
- P3-D60, colorspace: P3-D60
- P3-D60 PQ 1000 nits, colorspace: P3-D60 PQ (1000 nits)
- P3-D60 PQ 2000 nits, colorspace: P3-D60 PQ (2000 nits)
- P3-D60 PQ 4000 nits, colorspace: P3-D60 PQ (4000 nits)
- P3-DCI, colorspace: P3-DCI
- Rec.2020, colorspace: Rec.2020
- Rec.2020 ST2048 1000 nits, colorspace: Rec.2020 ST2048 (1000 nits)
- Rec.709, colorspace: Rec.709
- Rec.709 D60 sim., colorspace: Rec.709 (D60 sim.)
- Raw, colorspace: Raw
- Log, colorspace: ACEScc

Considerations for custom config generation:

- The choice of a single Display and many Views may not align well with the implementation of OCIO in an application. 
	- If you would like to generate a config that contains multiple Displays, with a small number of Views for each, review the config generation script's '--createMultipleDisplays' option.
- If a Look is added to the config, a new set of Views will be added, one for each of the Views listed above except Raw and Log, that includes the Look. The Views with Looks will be interleaved in the View list with the original Views.
	- To add a custom Look to the config, review the config generation script's '--addACESLookLUT', '--addACESLookCDL', '--addCustomLookLUT' and '--addCustomLookCDL' options.


LUTs
****

The default resolution is 65x65x65 for the 3D LUTs and 4096 for the 1D LUTs. 

**OCIO LUTs**
The LUTs used internally by OCIO can be can be retrieved `from the repository here. <https://github.com/hpd/OpenColorIO-Configs/tree/master/aces_1.0.3/luts>`_

**Baked LUTs**
LUTs that can be used outside of OCIO are included in the `'baked' directory here. <https://github.com/hpd/OpenColorIO-Configs/tree/master/aces_1.0.3/baked>`_

- The LUTs encode the ACES Output Transform for a specific colorspace input and are generally named:
	- 'Ouput Transform name' for 'Input colorspace name'.extension
	- Ex. 'sRGB (D60 sim.) for ACEScc.icc'

The LUTs included in the 'baked' directory cover the following formats and applications:

- .3dl for Autodesk Flame
- .3dl for Autodesk Lustre
- .lut for SideFX Houdini
- .csp for Autodesk Maya
- .icc for Adobe Photoshop


Generating Configurations
*************************

**Python**
Configurations can be generated by the following *Python* package: `aces_1.0.3/python <https://github.com/hpd/OpenColorIO-Configs/tree/master/aces_1.0.3/python>`_

Usage is described on the command line and in the package root `\_\_init__.py <https://github.com/hpd/OpenColorIO-Configs/blob/master/aces_1.0.3/python/aces_ocio/__init__.py>`_ file.

Features exposed for customization by the user include: 

- The resolution of 1D and 3D LUTs
- Inclusion of custom Looks
- Two modes of creating the list of OCIO Displays and Views
- Selection of shaper function: Log2 or Dolby PQ

**CTL Source**
The configuration depends on the **ACES 1.0.3** release. The release contains a number of file renames and the new ACEScct color space and a number of minor bug fixes and small additions, but is otherwise very similar as the main **ACES 1.0.2** release. 

The CTL is available here:

- https://github.com/ampas/aces-dev/tree/v1.0.3/transforms/ctl

Clone this repo using the following command:

- git clone --branch v1.0.3 https://github.com/ampas/aces-dev.git
