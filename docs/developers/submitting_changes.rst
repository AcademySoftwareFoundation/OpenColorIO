Code Review
***********

Ask early, and ask often!

All new contributors are highly encouraged to post development ideas, questions,
or any other thoughts to the :ref:`mailing_lists` before starting to code.  This
greatly improves the process and quality of the resulting library.   Code
reviews (particularly for non-trivial changes) are typically far simpler if the
reviewers are aware of a development task beforehand. (And, who knows? Maybe they
will have implementation suggestions as well!)
