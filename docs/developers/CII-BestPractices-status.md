## Introduction

This is a set of best practices
for Free/Libre and Open Source Software (FLOSS) projects.
Projects that follow these best practices
will be able to voluntarily self-certify and show that they've
achieved a Core Infrastructure Initiative (CII) badge.
Projects can do this, at no cost,
by using a web application (BadgeApp)
to explain how they meet these practices and their detailed criteria.

There is no set of practices that can guarantee that software
will never have defects or vulnerabilities;
even formal methods can fail if the specifications or assumptions are wrong.
Nor is there any set of practices that can guarantee that a project will
sustain a healthy and well-functioning development community.
However, following best practices can help improve the results
of projects.
For example, some practices enable multi-person review before release,
which can both help find otherwise hard-to-find technical vulnerabilities
and help build trust and a desire for repeated interaction among developers
from different organizations.

These best practices have been created to:

1. encourage projects to follow best practices,
2. help new projects discover what those practices are, and
3. help users know which projects are following best practices
   (so users can prefer such projects).

The idiom "best practices" means
"a procedure or set of procedures that is preferred or considered
standard within an organization, industry, etc."
(source:
<a href="http://www.dictionary.com/browse/best-practice">Dictionary.com</a>).
These criteria are what we believe are
widely "preferred or considered standard"
in the wider FLOSS community.

The "passing" criteria listed here focus on identifying best practices
that well-run FLOSS projects typically already follow.
The criteria are inspired by a variety of sources;
see the separate "[background](./background.md)" page for more information.

[The criteria for higher/more advanced badges](./other.md)
describe the criteria for the higher-level badges.
These are known as the "silver" and "gold" levels, and sometimes also
described as "other" criteria.
You must achieve the "passing" criteria before you can achieve
silver or gold.

The Linux Foundation also sponsors the
[OpenChain Project](https://www.openchainproject.org/), which
identifies criteria for a "high quality Free
and Open Source Software (FOSS) compliance program."
OpenChain focuses on how organizations can best use FLOSS and contribute
back to FLOSS projects, while the CII Best Practices badge
focuses on the FLOSS projects themselves.
The CII Best Practices badge and OpenChain work together to help
improve FLOSS and how FLOSS is used.

We expect that these practices and their detailed criteria will be updated,
even after badges are released.
Thus, criteria (and badges) probably will have a year identifier
and will phase out after a year or two.
We expect it will be easy to update the information,
so this relatively short badge life should not be a barrier.
We plan to add new criteria but mark them as "future" criteria, so that
projects can add that information and maintain their badge.

Feedback is *very* welcome via the
[GitHub site as issues or pull requests](https://github.com/coreinfrastructure/best-practices-badge).
There is also a
[mailing list for general discussion](https://lists.coreinfrastructure.org/mailman/listinfo/cii-badges).

Below are the current criteria, along with and where to get more information.
The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT",
"SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", and "MAY"
in this document are to be interpreted as described in
[RFC 2119](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119).
The additional term SUGGESTED is added, as follows:

- The term MUST is an absolute requirement, and MUST NOT
  is an absolute prohibition.
- The term SHOULD indicates a criterion that is normally required,
  but there may exist valid reasons in particular circumstances to ignore it.
  However, the full implications must be understood and carefully weighed
  before choosing a different course.
- The term SUGGESTED is used instead of SHOULD when the criterion must
  be considered, but valid reasons
  to not do so are even more common than for SHOULD.
- Often a criterion is stated as something that SHOULD be done, or is
  SUGGESTED, because it may be difficult to implement or the costs
  to do so may be high.
- The term MAY provides one way something can be done, e.g.,
  to make it clear that the described implementation is acceptable.
- To obtain a badge, all MUST and MUST NOT criteria must be met, all
  SHOULD criteria must be met OR the rationale for
  not implementing the criterion must be documented, and
  all SUGGESTED criteria have to be considered (rated as met or unmet).
  In some cases a URL may be required as part of the criterion's justification.
- The text "(Future criterion)" marks criteria that are not currently
  required, but may be required in the future.

We assume that you are already familiar with
software development and running a FLOSS project;
if not, see introductory materials such as
[*Producing Open Source Software* by Karl Fogel](http://producingoss.com/).

## Terminology

A *project* is an active entity that has project member(s) and produces
project result(s).
Its member(s) use project sites to coordinate and disseminate result(s).
A project does not need to be a formal legal entity.
Key terms relating to project are:

*   Project *members* are the
    group of one or more people or companies who work together
    to attempt to produce project results.
    Some FLOSS projects may have different kinds of members, with different
    roles, but that's outside our scope.
*   Project *results* are what the project members work together
    to produce as their end goal. Normally this is software,
    but project results may include other things as well.
    Criteria that refer to "software produced by the project"
    are referring to project results.
*   Project *sites* are the sites dedicated to supporting the development
    and dissemination of project results, and include
    the project website, repository, and download sites where applicable
    (see <a href="#sites_https">sites_https</a>).
*   The project *website*, aka project homepage, is the main page
    on the world wide web (WWW) that a new user would typically visit to see
    information about the project; it may be the same as the project's
    repository site (this is often true on GitHub).
*   The project *repository* manages and stores the project results
    and revision history of the project results.
    This is also referred to as the project *source repository*,
    because we only require managing and storing of the editable versions,
    not of automatically generated results
    (in many cases generated results are not stored in a repository).

## Current criteria: Best Practices for FLOSS

Here are the current criteria.  Note that:

* Text inside square brackets is the short name of the criterion.
* In a few cases rationale is also included.
* We expect that there will be a few other fields for the
  project name, description, project URL, repository URL (which may be the
  same as the project URL), and license(s).
* In some cases N/A ("not applicable") may be an appropriate and permitted
  response.

In some cases we automatically test and fill in information
if the project follows standard conventions and
is hosted on a site (e.g., GitHub) with decent API support.
We intend to improve this automation in the future (improvements welcome!).

The actual criteria are stored in the file "criteria/criteria.yml", including
details, rationale, and how it could be automated.

There is an implied criterion that we should mention here:

- <a name="homepage_url"></a>The project MUST have a public website
  with a stable URL.
  (The badging application enforces this by requiring a URL to
  create a badge entry.)
  <sup>[<a href="#homepage_url">homepage_url</a>]</sup>


### Basics

<b><i>Basic project website content</i></b>

<ul>

<li><a name="description_good"></a>The project website MUST succinctly describe what the software does (what problem does it solve?). <sup>[<a href="#description_good">description_good</a>]</sup><dl><dt><i>Details</i>:<dt> <dd>This MUST be in language that potential users can understand (e.g., it uses minimal jargon).</dd></dl></li>

‚úÖ **OCIO done**

<li><a name="contribution"></a>The information on how to contribute MUST explain the contribution process (e.g., are pull requests used?) (URL required for "met".) <sup>[<a href="#contribution">contribution</a>]</sup><dl><dt><i>Details</i>:<dt> <dd>We presume that <a href="https://guides.github.com/activities/contributing-to-open-source/">projects on GitHub use issues and pull requests</a> unless otherwise noted. This information can be short, e.g., stating that the project uses pull requests, an issue tracker, or posts to a mailing list (which one?)</dd><dt><i>Rationale</i>:<dt> <dd>Contributors need to understand not only how to contribute, but also the overall contribution process, so that they'll understand how their work could be incorporated and what the expectations are after the initial submission. This means that wherever the project describes how to contribute, the project must include (directly or by reference) information on the contribution process.  Note that criterion "interact" (listed earlier) requires that the contribution information be on the project website.

<b><i>OSS License</i></b>

<ul>

<li><a name="floss_license"></a>The software produced by the project MUST be released as FLOSS. <sup>[<a href="#floss_license">floss_license</a>]</sup><dl><dt><i>Details</i>:<dt> <dd>FLOSS is software released in a way that meets the <a href="https://opensource.org/osd-annotated">Open Source Definition</a> or <a href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html">Free Software Definition</a>. Examples of such licenses include the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/">CC0</a>, <a href="https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT">MIT</a>, <a href="https://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-2-Clause">BSD 2-clause</a>, <a href="https://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause">BSD 3-clause revised</a>, <a href="https://opensource.org/licenses/Apache-2.0">Apache 2.0</a>, <a href="https://opensource.org/licenses/lgpl-license">Lesser GNU General Public License (LGPL)</a>, and the <a href="https://opensource.org/licenses/gpl-license">GNU General Public License (GPL)</a>. For our purposes, this means that the license MUST be: <ul> <li><a href="https://opensource.org/licenses">an approved license by the Open Source Initiative (OSI)</a>, or</li> <li><a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html">a free license as approved by the Free Software Foundation (FSF)</a>, or</li> <li><a href="https://www.debian.org/legal/licenses/">a free license acceptable to Debian main</a>, or</li> <li><a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Licensing:Main?rd=Licensing">a "good" license according to Fedora</a>.</li> </ul> The software MAY also be licensed other ways (e.g., "GPLv2 or proprietary" is acceptable).</dd><dt><i>Rationale</i>:<dt> <dd>These criteria are designed for FLOSS projects, so we need to ensure that they're only used where they apply. Some projects may be mistakenly considered FLOSS even though they are not (e.g., they might not have any license, in which case the defaults of the country's legal system apply, or they might use a non-FLOSS license). We've added "produced by the project" as a clarification - many projects use non-FLOSS software/services in the process of creating software, or depend on them to run, and that is allowed.
</dd></dl></li>

‚úÖ **OCIO done** https://github.com/imageworks/OpenColorIO/blob/master/LICENSE.md

<li><a name="floss_license_osi"></a>It is SUGGESTED that any required license(s) for the software produced by the project be <a href="https://opensource.org/licenses">approved by the Open Source Initiative (OSI).</a> <sup>[<a href="#floss_license_osi">floss_license_osi</a>]</sup><dl><dt><i>Details</i>:<dt> <dd>The OSI uses a rigorous approval process to determine which licenses are OSS.</dd><dt><i>Rationale</i>:<dt> <dd>Unusual licenses can cause long-term problems for FLOSS projects and are more difficult for tools to handle. That said, there are FLOSS licenses that are not OSI-approved, e.g., the CC0 license is used by many projects but is not OSI-approved at the time of this writing. We expect that more advanced badges would set a higher bar (e.g., that it <em>must</em> be released under an OSI-approved license).
</dd></dl></li>

‚úÖ **OCIO done** https://github.com/imageworks/OpenColorIO/blob/master/LICENSE.md

<li><a name="license_location"></a>The project MUST post the license(s) of its results in a standard location in their source repository. (URL required for "met".) <sup>[<a href="#license_location">license_location</a>]</sup><dl><dt><i>Details</i>:<dt> <dd>E.g., as a top-level file named LICENSE or COPYING. License filenames MAY be followed by an extension such as ".txt" or ".md". Note that this criterion is only a requirement on the source repository. You do NOT need to include the license file when generating something from the source code (such as an executable, package, or container). For example, when generating an R package for the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN), follow standard CRAN practice: if the license is a standard license, use the standard short license specification (to avoid installing yet another copy of the text) and list the LICENSE file in an exclusion file such as .Rbuildignore. Similarly, when creating a Debian package, you may put a link in the copyright file to the license text in /usr/share/common-licenses, and exclude the license file from the created package (e.g., by deleting the file after calling dh_auto_install). We do encourage including machine-readable license information in generated formats where practical.</dd><dt><i>Rationale</i>:<dt> <dd>The goal is to make the license very clear and connected with the project results it applies to.  It is a good idea to also make the license clear on the project website, but there isn't a widely-accepted way to do that today.

</ul>

<b><i>Documentation</i></b>

<ul>

<li><a name="documentation_basics"></a>The project MUST provide basic documentation for the software produced by the project. (N/A allowed.) (Justification required for "N/A".) <sup>[<a href="#documentation_basics">documentation_basics</a>]</sup><dl><dt><i>Details</i>:<dt> <dd>This documentation must be in some media (such as text or video) that includes: how to install it, how to start it, how to use it (possibly with a tutorial using examples), and how to use it securely (e.g., what to do and what not to do) if that is an appropriate topic for the software. The security documentation need not be long. The project MAY use hypertext links to non-project material as documentation. If the project does not produce software, choose "not applicable" (N/A).</dd><dt><i>Rationale</i>:<dt> <dd>Potential users need documentation so that they can learn how to use the software. This documentation could be provided via the project website or repository, or even via hyperlink to some external information, so we do not specify exactly where this information is.
</dd></dl></li>

‚úÖ **OCIO done**

<li><a name="documentation_interface"></a>The project MUST provide reference documentation that describes the external interface (both input and output) of the software produced by the project. (N/A allowed.) (Justification required for "N/A".) <sup>[<a href="#documentation_interface">documentation_interface</a>]</sup><dl><dt><i>Details</i>:<dt> <dd>The documentation of an external interface explains to an end-user or developer how to use it.  This would include its application program interface (API) if the software has one. If it is a library, document the major classes/types and methods/functions that can be called. If it is a web application, define its URL interface (often its REST interface). If it is a command-line interface, document the parameters and options it supports. In many cases it's best if most of this documentation is automatically generated, so that this documentation stays synchronized with the software as it changes, but this isn't required. The project MAY use hypertext links to non-project material as documentation. Documentation MAY be automatically generated (where practical this is often the best way to do so). Documentation of a REST interface may be generated using Swagger/OpenAPI. Code interface documentation MAY be generated using tools such as <a href="http://usejsdoc.org/">JSDoc</a> (JavaScript), <a href="https://esdoc.org/">ESDoc</a> (JavaScript), pydoc (Python), <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/devtools/index.html">devtools</a> (R), <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/pkgdown/index.html">pkgdown</a> (R), and Doxygen (many).  Merely having comments in implementation code is not sufficient to satisfy this criterion; there needs to be an easy way to see the information without reading through all the source code. If the project does not produce software, choose "not applicable" (N/A).</dd></dl></li>

</ul>

<b><i>Other</i></b>

<ul>

<li><a name="sites_https"></a>The project sites (website, repository, and download URLs) MUST support HTTPS using TLS. <sup>[<a href="#sites_https">sites_https</a>]</sup><dl><dt><i>Details</i>:<dt> <dd>This requires that the project home page URL and the version control repository URL begin with "https:", not "http:". You can get free certificates from <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/">Let's Encrypt</a>. Projects MAY implement this criterion using (for example) <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/securing-your-github-pages-site-with-https/">GitHub pages</a>, <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/2016/12/24/were-bringing-gitlab-pages-to-community-edition/">GitLab pages</a>, or <a href="https://sourceforge.net/blog/introducing-https-for-project-websites/">SourceForge project pages</a>.  If you are using GitHub pages with custom domains, you MAY use a content delivery network (CDN) as a proxy to support HTTPS, such as described in the <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/secure-and-fast-github-pages-with-cloudflare/">blog post "Secure and fast GitHub Pages with CloudFlare"</a>, to satisfy this criterion. If you support HTTP, we urge you to redirect the HTTP traffic to HTTPS.</dd></dl></li>

üî∂ **OCIO partial** The GitHub page is https, but http://opencolorio.org/ is not.

<li><a name="discussion"></a>The project MUST have one or more mechanisms for discussion (including proposed changes and issues) that are searchable, allow messages and topics to be addressed by URL, enable new people to participate in some of the discussions, and do not require client-side installation of proprietary software. <sup>[<a href="#discussion">discussion</a>]</sup><dl><dt><i>Details</i>:<dt> <dd>Examples of acceptable mechanisms include archived mailing list(s), GitHub issue and pull request discussions, Bugzilla, Mantis, and Trac. Asynchronous discussion mechanisms (like IRC) are acceptable if they meet these criteria; make sure there is a URL-addressable archiving mechanism. Proprietary JavaScript, while discouraged, is permitted.</dd></dl></li>

‚úÖ **OCIO done**  GH Issues, mail lists, Slack.

<li><a name="english"></a>The project SHOULD provide documentation in English and be able to accept bug reports and comments about code in English. <sup>[<a href="#english">english</a>]</sup><dl><dt><i>Details</i>:<dt> <dd>English is currently the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lingua_franca">lingua franca</a> of computer technology; supporting English increases the number of different potential developers and reviewers worldwide. A project can meet this criterion even if its core developers' primary language is not English.</dd></dl></li>

‚úÖ **OCIO done**

</ul>


### Change Control

<b><i>Public version-controlled source repository</i></b>

<ul>

<li><a name="repo_public"></a>The project MUST have a version-controlled source repository that is publicly readable and has a URL. <sup>[<a href="#repo_public">repo_public</a>]</sup><dl><dt><i>Details</i>:<dt> <dd>The URL MAY be the same as the project URL. The project MAY use private (non-public) branches in specific cases while the change is not publicly released (e.g., for fixing a vulnerability before it is revealed to the public).</dd></dl></li>

‚úÖ **OCIO done**

<li><a name="repo_track"></a>The project's source repository MUST track what changes were made, who made the changes, and when the changes were made. <sup>[<a href="#repo_track">repo_track</a>]</sup></li>

‚úÖ **OCIO done**

<li><a name="repo_interim"></a>To enable collaborative review, the project's source repository MUST include interim versions for review between releases; it MUST NOT include only final releases. <sup>[<a href="#repo_interim">repo_interim</a>]</sup><dl><dt><i>Details</i>:<dt> <dd>Projects MAY choose to omit specific interim versions from their public source repositories (e.g., ones that fix specific non-public security vulnerabilities, may never be publicly released, or include material that cannot be legally posted and are not in the final release).</dd></dl></li>

‚úÖ **OCIO done**

<li><a name="repo_distributed"></a>It is SUGGESTED that common distributed version control software be used (e.g., git) for the project's source repository. <sup>[<a href="#repo_distributed">repo_distributed</a>]</sup><dl><dt><i>Details</i>:<dt> <dd>Git is not specifically required and projects can use centralized version control software (such as subversion) with justification.</dd></dl></li>

‚úÖ **OCIO done**

</ul>

<b><i>Unique version numbering</i></b>

<ul>

<li><a name="version_unique"></a>The project results MUST have a unique version identifier for each release intended to be used by users. <sup>[<a href="#version_unique">version_unique</a>]</sup><dl><dt><i>Details</i>:<dt> <dd>This MAY be met in a variety of ways including a commit IDs (such as git commit id or mercurial changeset id) or a version number (including version numbers that use semantic versioning or date-based schemes like YYYYMMDD).</dd></dl></li>

‚úÖ **OCIO done**

<li><a name="version_semver"></a>It is SUGGESTED that the <a href="http://semver.org">Semantic Versioning (SemVer) format</a> be used for releases. <sup>[<a href="#version_semver">version_semver</a>]</sup><dl><dt><i>Details</i>:<dt> <dd>Other version numbering schemes, such as commit IDs (such as git commit id or mercurial changeset id) or date-based schemes like YYYYMMDD, MAY be used as version numbers, since they are unique. Some alternatives can cause problems, because users may not be able to easily determine if they are up-to-date. SemVer may be less helpful for identifying software releases if all recipients only run the latest version (e.g., it is the code for a single website or internet service that is constantly updated via continuous delivery).</dd><dt><i>Rationale</i>:<dt> <dd>SemVer is widely used to communicate what an update is (e.g., if it involves incompatible API changes), whether something is newer or older.  The scheme is simple, supports multiple simultaneous branches, and because it uses at least three numbers it can be distinguished from floating point. However, many find SemVer less useful for identifying software versions if only one version of the component is run (e.g., it is the code for a single website or internet service that is constantly updated via continuous delivery). For more discussion of the pros and cons of SemVer, see <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=13378637">Hacker News' Is Semantic Versioning an Anti-Pattern?</a> and <a href="https://surfingthe.cloud/semantic-versioning-anti-pattern/">The Semantic Versioning Anti-Pattern</a>.
</dd></dl></li>

‚úÖ **OCIO done**

<li><a name="version_tags"></a>It is SUGGESTED that projects identify each release within their version control system. For example, it is SUGGESTED that those using git identify each release using git tags. <sup>[<a href="#version_tags">version_tags</a>]</sup></li>

‚úÖ **OCIO done**

</ul>

<b><i>Release notes</i></b>

<ul>

<li><a name="release_notes"></a>The project MUST provide, in each release, release notes that are a human-readable summary of major changes in that release to help users determine if they should upgrade and what the upgrade impact will be. The release notes MUST NOT be the raw output of a version control log (e.g., the "git log" command results are not release notes). Projects whose results are not intended for reuse in multiple locations (such as the software for a single website or service) AND employ continuous delivery MAY select "N/A". (N/A allowed.) (Justification required for "N/A".) (URL required for "met".) <sup>[<a href="#release_notes">release_notes</a>]</sup><dl><dt><i>Details</i>:<dt> <dd>The release notes MAY be implemented in a variety of ways. Many projects provide them in a file named "NEWS", "CHANGELOG", or "ChangeLog", optionally with extensions such as ".txt", ".md", or ".html".  Historically the term "change log" meant a log of <em>every</em> change, but to meet these criteria what is needed is a human-readable summary.  The release notes MAY instead be provided by version control system mechanisms such as the <a href="https://github.com/blog/1547-release-your-software">GitHub Releases workflow</a>.</dd><dt><i>Rationale</i>:<dt> <dd>Release notes are important because they help users decide whether or not they will want to update, and what the impact would be (e.g., if the new release fixes vulnerabilities).  We realize this may not apply to projects whose main results are continuously updated and are deployed to primarily one place and so allow "N/A" from such projects.
</dd></dl></li>

‚úÖ **OCIO done**

<li><a name="release_notes_vulns"></a>The release notes MUST identify every publicly known vulnerability with a CVE assignment or similar that is fixed in each new release, unless users typically cannot practically update the software themselves. If there are no release notes or there have been no publicly known vulnerabilities, choose "not applicable" (N/A). (N/A allowed.) (Justification required for "N/A".) <sup>[<a href="#release_notes_vulns">release_notes_vulns</a>]</sup><dl><dt><i>Details</i>:<dt> <dd>If users typically cannot practically update the software themselves on their computers, but must instead depend on a middleman to perform the upgrade (as is often the case for a kernel and low-level software that is intertwined with a kernel), the project may choose "not applicable" (N/A).</dd></dl></li>

üè≥Ô∏è **N/A** No publicly known vulnerabilities

</ul>


### Reporting

<b><i>Bug-reporting process</i></b>

<ul>

<li><a name="report_process"></a>The project MUST provide a process for users to submit bug reports (e.g., using an issue tracker or a mailing list). (URL required for "met".) <sup>[<a href="#report_process">report_process</a>]</sup></li>

‚úÖ **OCIO done**

<li><a name="report_tracker"></a>The project SHOULD use an issue tracker for tracking individual issues. <sup>[<a href="#report_tracker">report_tracker</a>]</sup></li>

‚úÖ **OCIO done**

<li><a name="report_responses"></a>The project MUST acknowledge a majority of bug reports submitted in the last 2-12 months (inclusive); the response need not include a fix. <sup>[<a href="#report_responses">report_responses</a>]</sup></li>

üî∂ **OCIO partial** *Most* GH issues have been acknowledged with a response or tag

<li><a name="enhancement_responses"></a>The project SHOULD respond to a majority (&gt;50%) of enhancement requests in the last 2-12 months (inclusive). <sup>[<a href="#enhancement_responses">enhancement_responses</a>]</sup><dl><dt><i>Details</i>:<dt> <dd>The response MAY be 'no' or a discussion about its merits. The goal is simply that there be some response to some requests, which indicates that the project is still alive. For purposes of this criterion, projects need not count fake requests (e.g., from spammers or automated systems). If a project is no longer making enhancements, please select "unmet" and include the URL that makes this situation clear to users. If a project tends to be overwhelmed by the number of enhancement requests, please select "unmet" and explain.</dd></dl></li>

üî∂ **OCIO partial** *Most* GH issues have been acknowledged with a response or tag

<li><a name="report_archive"></a>The project MUST have a publicly available archive for reports and responses for later searching. (URL required for "met".) <sup>[<a href="#report_archive">report_archive</a>]</sup></li>

‚úÖ **OCIO done**

</ul>

<b><i>Vulnerability report process</i></b>

<ul>

<li><a name="vulnerability_report_process"></a>The project MUST publish the process for reporting vulnerabilities on the project site. (URL required for "met".) <sup>[<a href="#vulnerability_report_process">vulnerability_report_process</a>]</sup><dl><dt><i>Details</i>:<dt> <dd>E.g., a clearly designated mailing address on https://PROJECTSITE/security, often in the form security@example.org.

E.G., multi-factor authentication, such as requiring both a password and a hardware token, is stronger than single-factor authentication) <li>least privilege (processes should operate with the least privilege necessary) <li>least common mechanism (the design should minimize the mechanisms common to more than one user and depended on by all users, e.g., directories for temporary files) <li>psychological acceptability (the human interface must be designed for ease of use - designing for "least astonishment" can help) <li>limited attack surface (the attack surface - the set of the different points where an attacker can try to enter or extract data - should be limited) <li>input validation with whitelists (inputs should typically be checked to determine if they are valid before they are accepted; this validation should use whitelists (which only accept known-good values), not blacklists (which attempt to list known-bad values)). </ul> A "primary developer" in a project is anyone who is familiar with the project's code base, is comfortable making changes to it, and is acknowledged as such by most other participants in the project. A primary developer would typically make a number of contributions over the past year (via code, documentation, or answering questions). Developers would typically be considered primary developers if they initiated the project (and have not left the project more than three years ago), have the option of receiving information on a private vulnerability reporting channel (if there is one), can accept commits on behalf of the project, or perform final releases of the project software. If there is only one developer, that individual is the primary developer.</dd></dl></li>

In many cases it's best to choose a block cipher algorithm mode designed to combine secrecy and authentication, e.g., Galois/Counter Mode (GCM) and EAX. Projects MAY allow users to enable broken mechanisms (e.g., during configuration) where necessary for compatibility, but then users know they're doing it.</dd><dt><i>Rationale</i>:<dt> <dd>If a cryptographic algorithm or mode is completely broken, then it cannot provide a useful cryptographic service. This is different from having a weakness; many cryptographic algorithms have some weaknesses, yet for backwards-compatibility it may sometimes be appropriate to use the algorithm anyway. "EAX" appears to be a name, not an abbrevation. The paper describing EAX, <a href="http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/ST/toolkit/BCM/documents/proposedmodes/eax/eax-spec.pdf">"A Conventional Authenticated-Encryption Mode" by M. Bellare, P.  Rogaway D.

## A note on good cryptographic practices

*Note*: These criteria do not always apply because some software has no
need to directly use cryptographic capabilities.
A "project security mechanism" is a security mechanism provided
by the delivered project's software.

## Non-criteria

We do *not* require any specific products or services, and in
general do not require any particular technology.
In particular, we do *not* require
proprietary tools, services, or technology,
since many [free software](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html)
developers would reject such criteria.
For example, we intentionally do *not* require git or GitHub.
We also do not require or forbid any particular programming language.
We do require that additional measures be taken for certain
*kinds* of programming languages, but that is different.
This means that as new tools and capabilities become available,
projects can quickly switch to them without failing to meet any criteria.

We *do* provide guidance and help for common cases.
The criteria *do* sometimes identify
common methods or ways of doing something
(especially if they are FLOSS), since that information
can help people understand and meet the criteria.
We also created an "easy on-ramp" for projects using git on GitHub,
since that is a common case.
But note that nothing *requires* git or GitHub.
We would welcome good patches that help provide an "easy on-ramp" for
projects on other repository platforms;
GitLab was one of the first projects with a badge.

We avoid requiring, at the passing level, criteria that would be
impractical for a single-person project, e.g., something that requires
a significant amount of money.
Many FLOSS projects are small, and we do not want to disenfranchise them.

We do not plan to require active user discussion within a project.
Some highly mature projects rarely change and thus may have little activity.
We *do*, however, require that the project be responsive
if vulnerabilities are reported to the project (see above).

## Uniquely identifying a project

One challenge is uniquely identifying a project.
Our Rails application gives a unique id to each new project, so
we can use that id to uniquely identify project entries.
However, that doesn't help people who searching for the project
and do not already know that id.

The *real* name of a project, for our purposes, is the
URL for its repository, and where that is not available, the
project "front page" URL can help find it.
Most projects have a human-readable name, and we provide a search
mechanims, but these names are not enough to uniquely identify a project.
The same human-readable name can be used for many different projects
(including project forks), and the same project may go by many different names.
In many cases it will be useful to point to other names for the project
(e.g., the source package name in Debian, the package name in some
language-specific repository, or its name in OpenHub).

In the future we may try to check more carefully that a user can
legitimately represent a project.
For the moment, we primarily focus on checking if GitHub repositories
are involved; there are ways to do this for other situations if that
becomes important.

Non-admin users cannot edit the repo URL once one is entered.
(Exception: they can upgrade http to https.)
If they could change the repo URL,
they might fool people into thinking they controlled
a project that they did not.
That said, creating a bogus row entry does not really help someone very
much; what matters to the software
is the id used by the project when it refers to its badge,
and the project determines that.

## Why have criteria?

The paper [Open badges for education: what are the implications at the
intersection of open systems and badging?](http://www.researchinlearningtechnology.net/index.php/rlt/article/view/23563)
identifies three general reasons for badging systems (all are valid for this):

1. Badges as a motivator of behavior.  We hope that by identifying
   best practices, we'll encourage projects to implement those
   best practices if they do not do them already.
2. Badges as a pedagogical tool.  Some projects may not be aware
   of some of the best practices applied by others,
   or how they can be practically applied.
   The badge will help them become aware of them and ways to implement them.
3. Badges as a signifier or credential.
   Potential users want to use projects that are applying best
   practices to consistently produce good results; badges make it easy
   for projects to signify that they are following best practices,
   and make it easy for users to see which projects are doing so.

We have chosen to use self-certification, because this makes it
possible for a large number of projects (even small ones) to
participate.  There's a risk that projects may make false claims,
but we think the risk is small, and users can check the claims for themselves.

## Improving the criteria

We are hoping to get good suggestions and feedback from the public;
please contribute!

We launched with a single badge level called *passing*.
For higher level badges, see [other](./other.md).

You may also want to see the "[background](./background.md)" file
for more information about these criteria,
and the "[implementation](./implementation.md)" notes
about the BadgeApp application.
