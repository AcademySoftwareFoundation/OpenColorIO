# **OCIO TSC Meeting Notes**

* Ext Directory
  - John Mertic and ASWF have no defined timeline for repo adoption
    - ASWF would prefer having more projects adopted by SIGGRAPH
  - Giving Mark another 2 weeks to take a look, otherwise will look at re-assigning that work

* OCIO Configs Repo
  - Missing licenses and relies on external Academy ACES code with incompatible license
  - Alex Forsyth or Scott Dyer will need to give us an update on how they anticipate handling it
  
* OCIO Domain https
  - There is a domain level issue preventing GitHub Pages from enabling https
  - **TODO**: John Mertic to submit a HelpDesk ticket about the issue
