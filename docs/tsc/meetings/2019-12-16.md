# **OCIO TSC Meeting Notes**

* GPU CI
    - Michael: For now, let's get a permanent instance running with help from LF.
      Need to get billing/credit side sorted with AWS also.

* Spark conference in Vancouver
    - Michael: Matthias and Mario have agreed to run an OCIO BoF at this conference in
      February.  We should all discuss/plan details.
    - Perhaps invite them to attend a TSC meeting.
    - Audience questions may be interesting to share, will it be recorded?  Join remotely?

* Misc. Items
    - Carl: Joining Weta but would like to stay involved in OCIO.
    - Need to follow up on Foundry representation.
