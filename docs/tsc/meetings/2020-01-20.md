# **OCIO TSC Meeting Notes**

* String utilities (PR #909)
  - also have src/apps/apputils

* python bindings (pybind)
  - what are the default values?

* Mission Statement (PR #890)
  - Just waiting for CLA stuff from EPIC

* PR #898
  - Content merged via another commit. Going to close but will investigate CLA issues

* Spark BOF
  - Mostly students, so will treat more as intro to OCIO / color management

* New Nuke behaviour
  - Now OCIO colour management is the default, lots more colourspaces in menus
  - Hopefully aleiviated by future hiding colourspaces feature
  - No Foundry rep as of yet (now that Carl is at Weta). Carl will reach out to Foundry
