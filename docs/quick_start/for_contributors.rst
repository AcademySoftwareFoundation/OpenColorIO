Quick Start for Contributors
============================

First decide how you want to contribute to OCIO.  We're looking for help with
testing, example configs, and documentation as well as actual coding.

* If you want to write code, start by looking at the :ref:`quick_start_devs`
  and join the #dev channel on :ref:`slack`.  Take a look on GitHub at the
  issues with the ``good first issue`` label.

* If you want to help develop config files, start by looking at :ref:`quick_start_config_authors`
  and join the #configs channel on :ref:`slack`.  From there, you may want to join the
  OCIO Configs working group.

* If you want to help with documentation, join the #docs and #ux channel on :ref:`slack`.

* If you want to help test, join the #general channel on :ref:`slack` and
  let us know you want to help test.

The :ref:`contributing` guide has a ton of useful information about most 
aspects of contributing to OCIO.

Check out :ref:`upgrading_to_v2` for an overview of the new features in OCIO v2.
