Introduction
============

.. warning::
    This section is from OCIO v1 and has not been updated yet.

OpenColorIO (OCIO) is a complete color management solution geared towards motion
picture production with an emphasis on visual effects and computer animation. As
such, OCIO helps enforce a color management methodology that is required for the
high fidelity color imaging in modern computer graphics. This section introduces
those concepts and general workflow practices. Additional information can be
found in Jeremy Selan's Cinematic Color `document <http://cinematiccolor.org/>`_.

While OCIO is a color management library, it's only knowledge of color science
comes from it's execution of the transforms defined in the OCIO configuration
file. These transforms are either defined by the end user in a custom OCIO
config or inherited from the publicly available configs.

By specifying your desired ``config.ocio`` Config file in the local environment
all OCIO compatible applications and software libraries will be able to see your
defined color transform "universe", and direct the transformation of image data
from one defined ``OCIO.ColorSpace`` to another, in addition to the other
transforms documented elsewhere.

Sony Pictures Imageworks Color Pipeline
***************************************

This document describes a high-level overview on how to emulate the current
color management practice at Sony Imageworks. It applies equally to all profiles
used at Imageworks, including both the VFX and Animation profiles.  It's by no
means a requirement to follow this workflow at your own facility, this is merely
a guideline on how we choose to work.

General Pipeline Observations
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

* All images, on disk, contain colorspace information as a substring within the
  filename.  This is obeyed by all applications that load image, write images,
  or view images.  File extensions and metadata are ignored with regards to
  color processing.

Example::

      colorimage_lnf.exr  : lnf
      dataimage_ncf.exr : ncf
      plate_lg10.dpx : lg10
      texture_dt8.tif : dt8

.. note::

    File format extension does **NOT** imply a color space.  Not all .dpx
    files are lg10. Not all .tif images are dt8.

* The common file formats we use are exr, tif, dpx.

 * render outputs: exr
 * render inputs (mipmapped-textures): exr, tif (txtif)
 * photographic plates (scans): dpx
 * composite outputs: dpx, exr
 * on-set reference: (camera raw) NEF, CR2, etc.
 * painted textures: psd, tif
 * output proxies: jpg

* All pipelines that need to be colorspace aware rely
  on ``Config.parseColorSpaceFromString``.

* Color configurations are show specific. The ``$OCIO`` environment variable is
  set as part of a 'setshot' process, before other applications are launched.
  Artists are not allowed to work across different shows without using a fresh
  shell + setshot.

* While the list of colorspaces can be show specific, care is taken to maintain
  similar naming to the greatest extent feasible. This reduces artist confusion.
  Even if two color spaces are not identical across shows, if they serve a
  similar purpose they are named the same.  

 * Example: We label 10-bit scanned film negatives as lg10. Even if two
   different shows use different acquisition film stocks, and rely on different
   linearization curves, they are both labeled lg10.

* There is no explicit guarantee that image assets copied across shows will be
  transferable in a color-correct manner. For example, in the above film scan
  example, one would not expect that the linearized versions of scans processed
  on different shows to match. In practice, this is not a problematic issue as
  the colorspaces which are convenient to copy (such as texture assets) happen
  to be similarly defined across show profiles.


Rendering
+++++++++

* Rendering and shading occurs in a scene-linear floating point space, typically
  named "ln".  Half-float (16-bit) images are labeled lnh, full float images
  (32-bit) are labeled lnf.

* All image inputs should be converted to ln prior to render-time. Typically,
  this is done when textures are published. (See below) 

* Renderer outputs are always floating-point. Color outputs are typically stored
  as lnh (16-bit half float). 

* Data outputs (normals, depth data, etc) are stored as ncf ("not color" data,
  32-bit full float). Lossy compression is never utilized.

* Render outputs are always viewed with an OCIO compatible image viewer.
  Thus, for typical color imagery the lnf display transform will be applied.
  In Nuke, this can be emulated using the `OCIODisplay` node. A standalone image
  viewer, ociodisplay, is also included with OpenColorIO src/example.

Texture Painting / Matte Painting
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

* Textures are painted either in a non-OCIO color-managed environment (Photoshop,
  etc), or a color managed one like Mari.

* At texture publish time, before mipmaps are generated, all color processing is
  applied. Internally at SPI we use OpenImageIO's maketx that also links to
  OpenColorIO. This code is available on the public OIIO repository. Color 
  processing (linearization) is applied before mipmap generation in order to
  assure energy preservation in the render. If the opposite processing order
  were used, (mipmap in the original space, color convert in the shader), the
  apparent intensity of texture values would change as the object approached or
  receded from the camera.

* The original texture filenames contain the colorspace information as a
  substring, to signify processing intent.

* Textures that contain data (bump maps, opacity maps, blend maps, etc) are
  labeled with the nc colorspaces according to their bitdepth.

 * Example: an 8-bit opacity map -> skin_opacity_nc8.tif

* Painted textures that are intended to modulate diffuse color components are
  labeled dt (standing for "diffuse texture").  The dt8 colorspace is designed
  such that, when linearized, values will not extend above 1.0.  At texture
  publishing time these are converted to lnh mipmapped tiffs/exr. Note that as
  linear textures have greater allocation requirements, a bit depth promotion
  is required in this case.  I.e., even if the original texture as painted was
  only 8-bits, the mipmapped texture will be stored as a 16-bit float image.

* Painted environment maps, which may be emissive as labeled vd (standing for
  'video'). These values, when linearized, have the potential to generate
  specular information well above 1.0. Note that in the current vd linearization
  curves, the top code values may be very "sensitive". I.e., very small changes
  in the initial code value (such as 254->255) may actually result in very large
  differences in the estimated scene-linear intensity. All environment maps are
  store as lnh mipmapped tiffs/exr. The same bit-depth promotion as in the dt8
  case is required here.

Compositing
+++++++++++

* The majority of compositing operations happen in scene-linear, lnf, colorspace.

* All image inputs are linearized to lnf as they are loaded.  Customized input
  nodes make this processing convenient.  Rendered elements, which are stored in
  linear already, do not require processing.  Photographic plates will typically
  be linearized according to their source type, (lg10 for film scans, gn10 for
  genesis sources, etc).

* All output images are de-linearized from lnf when they are written. A
  customized output node makes this convenient.

* On occasion log data is required for certain processing operations.
  (Plate resizing, pulling keys, degrain, etc).  For each show, a colorspace is
  specified as appropriate for this operation.  The artist does not have to keep
  track of which colorspace is appropriate to use; the OCIOLogConvert node is
  always intended for this purpose.  (Within the OCIO profile, this is specified
  using the 'compositing_log' role).
