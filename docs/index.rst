Overview
========

OpenColorIO (OCIO) is a complete color management solution geared towards motion
picture production with an emphasis on visual effects and computer animation.
OCIO provides a straightforward and consistent user experience across all
supporting applications while allowing for sophisticated back-end configuration
options suitable for high-end production usage. OCIO is compatible with the
Academy Color Encoding Specification (ACES) and is LUT-format agnostic,
supporting many popular formats.

OpenColorIO version 1.0 was released in 2011, having been in development since 2003.
OCIO v1 represented the culmination of years of production experience earned on such
films as SpiderMan 2 (2004), Surf's Up (2007), Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs
(2009), Alice in Wonderland (2010), and many more.  

OpenColorIO v2 was in development from 2017 to 2020 and was feature complete as of
SIGGRAPH 2020 and was released in January of 2021. Development has continued to be
active since then with annual releases around September, timed in relation to the
`VFX Reference Platform <https://vfxplatform.com/>`_.  Here is more information 
about our :ref:`upgrading_to_v2`.


About the Documentation
=======================

The documentation has been updated to include basic coverage of the new OCIO v2 features
but additional work is needed to provide more detail and tutorials about how to
best leverage them.  We have an OCIO User Experience (UX) working group that is
gradually working on more coverage.

The documentation is a work-in-progress and we would love to have your help to 
improve it!  An easy way to get involved is to join the #opencolorio channel on 
:ref:`slack`.


Roadmap
=======

The project attempts to maintain a roadmap to give the community insight into
upcoming development. The items are grouped into "Now", "Next", and "Later" categories.
"Now" indicates work that is currently in-progress. "Next" indicates work that is being
planned for imminent development (meaning now would be a good time to provide your input).
The roadmap is available `here. <https://roadmap.opencolorio.org>`_

ASWF Color Interop Forum
************************

The CIF is an open, cross-project forum for discussing color interoperability across varying workflows 
and standards. The aim isn’t necessarily to develop new standards, but rather to make recommendations 
for how to improve color accuracy through the existing infrastructure. 

Recommendations are published on the `ColorInterop GitHub. <https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/ColorInterop>`_

The forum has a monthly Zoom meeting on Mondays at noon LA time, as posted on the 
`OCIO Calendar. <https://calendar.opencolorio.org>`_

Discussion happens in the `#color-interop-forum` channel on the ASWF Slack.


.. _nano:

NanoColor
*********

NanoColor is a collaboration between OpenUSD, MaterialX, and OpenColorIO to ensure that there 
is interoperable and flexible color management among those projects and related projects in 
the computer graphics world.

The working group has a Zoom meeting every two weeks on Mondays at 1:00 pm LA time, as posted on the 
`OCIO Calendar. <https://calendar.opencolorio.org>`_
