Overview
========

OpenColorIO (OCIO) is a complete color management solution geared towards motion
picture production with an emphasis on visual effects and computer animation.
OCIO provides a straightforward and consistent user experience across all
supporting applications while allowing for sophisticated back-end configuration
options suitable for high-end production usage. OCIO is compatible with the
Academy Color Encoding Specification (ACES) and is LUT-format agnostic,
supporting many popular formats.

OpenColorIO version 1.0 was released in 2011, having been in development since 2003.
OCIO v1 represented the culmination of years of production experience earned on such
films as SpiderMan 2 (2004), Surf's Up (2007), Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs
(2009), Alice in Wonderland (2010), and many more.  

OpenColorIO v2 has been in development since 2017 and was feature complete as of
SIGGRAPH 2020.  After a stabilization and bug-fixing period, an official 2.0.0 
release was made in January 2021.  OCIO v2 is in the VFX Reference Platform for
calendar year 2021.  The OCIO v2 code is in the RB-2.0 branch on 
`GitHub <https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/OpenColorIO>`_
and we encourage developers to start integrating and providing feedback.
See :ref:`upgrading_to_v2` for more.


About the Documentation
=======================

The documentation is a work-in-progress and we would love to have your help to 
improve it!  An easy way to get involved is to join the #docs channel on 
:ref:`slack`.

The documentation has been updated to include most of the new OCIO v2 features
but additional work is needed to provide more detail and tutorials about how to
best leverage them.  We will be working on that over the coming weeks.
