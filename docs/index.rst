OpenColorIO (OCIO) is a complete color management solution geared towards motion
picture production with an emphasis on visual effects and computer animation.
OCIO provides a straightforward and consistent user experience across all
supporting applications while allowing for sophisticated back-end configuration
options suitable for high-end production usage. OCIO is compatible with the
Academy Color Encoding Specification (ACES) and is LUT-format agnostic,
supporting many popular formats.

OpenColorIO is released as version 1.0 and has been in development since 2003.
OCIO represents the culmination of years of production experience earned on such
films as SpiderMan 2 (2004), Surf's Up (2007), Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs
(2009), Alice in Wonderland (2010), and many more. OpenColorIO is natively
supported in commercial applications like Katana, Mari, Nuke, Silhouette FX, and
others.

Mailing Lists
*************

There are two mailing lists associated with OpenColorIO:

`ocio-user <https://lists.aswf.io/g/ocio-user>`__\ ``@lists.aswf.io``
    For end users (artists, often) interested in OCIO profile design,
    facility color management, and workflow.

`ocio-dev <https://lists.aswf.io/g/ocio-dev>`__\ ``@lists.aswf.io``
    For developers interested OCIO APIs, code integration, compilation, etc.

Quick Start
***********

Most users will likely want to use the OpenColorIO that comes precompiled with
their applications.  See the :ref:`compatiblesoftware` for further details on
each application.

Note that OCIO configurations are required to do any 'real' work, and are
available separately on the :ref:`downloads` section of this site. Example
images are also available. For assistance customizing .ocio configurations,
contact `ocio-user <https://lists.aswf.io/g/ocio-user>`__\.

- Step 1:  set the OCIO environment-variable to /path/to/your/profile.ocio
- Step 2:  Launch supported application.

If you are on a platform that is not envvar friendly, most applications also
provide a menu option to select a different OCIO configuration after launch.

Please be sure to select a profile that matches your color workflow (VFX work
typically requires a different profile than animated features). If you need
assistance picking a profile, email 
`ocio-user <https://lists.aswf.io/g/ocio-user>`__\.
