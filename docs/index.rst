Overview
========

OpenColorIO (OCIO) is a complete color management solution geared towards motion
picture production with an emphasis on visual effects and computer animation.
OCIO provides a straightforward and consistent user experience across all
supporting applications while allowing for sophisticated back-end configuration
options suitable for high-end production usage. OCIO is compatible with the
Academy Color Encoding Specification (ACES) and is LUT-format agnostic,
supporting many popular formats.

OpenColorIO version 1.0 was released in 2011, having been in development since 2003.
OCIO v1 represented the culmination of years of production experience earned on such
films as SpiderMan 2 (2004), Surf's Up (2007), Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs
(2009), Alice in Wonderland (2010), and many more.  

OpenColorIO v2 was in development from 2017 to 2020 and was feature complete as of
SIGGRAPH 2020.  After a stabilization and bug-fixing period, an official 2.0.0 
release was made in January 2021.  Development has continued to be active since
then with the 2.1 release in 2021, the 2.2 release in 2022, and the 2.3 release
in 2023 adding even more capabilities.  Here is more information about our :ref:`upgrading_to_v2`.


About the Documentation
=======================

The documentation has been updated to include basic coverage of the new OCIO v2 features
but additional work is needed to provide more detail and tutorials about how to
best leverage them.  We have an OCIO User Experience (UX) working group that is
gradually working on more coverage.

The documentation is a work-in-progress and we would love to have your help to 
improve it!  An easy way to get involved is to join the #docs or #ux channel on 
:ref:`slack`.
