CLA and DCO
===========

OpenColorIO is a project hosted by the Academy Software Foundation (ASWF) and 
follows the open source software best practice policies of the ASWF TAC with 
the guidance from the Linux Foundation.

See `CONTRIBUTING.md 
<https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/OpenColorIO/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md>`__ 
for more information.

CLA
***

Developers who wish to contribute code to be considered for inclusion in 
OpenColorIO (OCIO) must first complete a Contributor License Agreement (CLA).

OCIO uses `EasyCLA <https://lfcla.com/>`__ for managing CLAs, which 
automatically checks to ensure CLAs are signed by a contributor before a commit 
can be merged.

If you are an individual writing the code on your own time and you're SURE you 
are the sole owner of any intellectual property you contribute, you can 
:ref:`sign the CLA as an individual contributor <icla>`.

If you are writing the code as part of your job, or if there is any possibility 
that your employers might think they own any intellectual property you create, 
then you should use the :ref:`Corporate Contributor Licence Agreement <ccla>`.

The OCIO CLA's are the standard forms used by Linux Foundation projects and 
`recommended by the ASWF TAC 
<https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/tac/blob/main/process/contributing.md#contributor-license-agreement-cla>`__.

Commit Sign-Off
***************

Every commit must be signed off. That is, every commit log message must include 
a “Signed-off-by” line (generated, for example, with “git commit --signoff” or 
"git commit -s"), indicating that the committer wrote the code and has the 
right to release it under the Modified-BSD-3-Clause license.

Here is an example Signed-off-by line, which indicates that the submitter 
accepts the DCO::

    Signed-off-by: John Doe <john.doe@example.com>

If John Doe has signed an individual CLA, or his corporation's CLA Manager has 
included his GitHub account in a corporate CLA approved list, his pull request 
can be merged. Otherwise the EasyCLA system will provide instructions on 
signing a CLA, or request inclusion in an existing corporate CLA approved list.

See the ASWF TAC CONTRIBUTING.md file for more information on this requirement.
