Application Helpers
===================

OCIO v2 includes a collection of helper code intended to ease the development
of applications.  This is located in src/OpenColorIO/apphelpers.

There are helpers for tasks such as:

* Building application color space menus that are able to filter by category and 
  that are able to display hierarchical menus.

* Building a viewing pipeline for an application viewport with dynamic exposure
  adjustment.

* Writing a color picker that handles scene-linear color encodings well.

* Adding new color spaces or new views to a config file.

More documentation and usage examples are planned.  Please stay tuned ...
