OpenColorIO (OCIO) is a complete color management solution geared towards motion
picture production with an emphasis on visual effects and computer animation.
OCIO provides a straightforward and consistent user experience across all
supporting applications while allowing for sophisticated back-end configuration
options suitable for high-end production usage. OCIO is compatible with the
Academy Color Encoding Specification (ACES) and is LUT-format agnostic,
supporting many popular formats.

OpenColorIO is released as version 1.0 and has been in development since 2003.
OCIO represents the culmination of years of production experience earned on such
films as SpiderMan 2 (2004), Surf's Up (2007), Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs
(2009), Alice in Wonderland (2010), and many more. OpenColorIO is natively
supported in commercial applications like Katana, Mari, Nuke, Silhouette FX, and others.

OpenColorIO is free (http://opencolorio.org/License.html) and is one of
several open source projects actively sponsored by Sony Imageworks (http://opensource.imageworks.com)
