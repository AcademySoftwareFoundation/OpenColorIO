OpenColorIO (OCIO) is a complete color management solution geared towards
motion picture production with an emphasis on visual effects and computer
animation. OCIO provides a straightforward and consistent user experience
across all supporting applications while allowing for sophisticated back-end
configuration options suitable for high-end production usage. OCIO is
compatible with the Academy Color Encoding Specification (ACES) and is
LUT-format agnostic, supporting many popular formats.

OpenColorIO is released as version 2.0 and has been in development since 2003.
OCIO represents the culmination of years of production experience earned on
such films as SpiderMan 2 (2004), Surf's Up (2007), Cloudy with a Chance of
Meatballs (2009), Alice in Wonderland (2010), and many more. OpenColorIO is
natively supported in commercial applications like Katana, Mari, Nuke, Maya,
Houdini, Silhouette FX, and
[others](https://opencolorio.org/#supported_apps).

OpenColorIO is free and open source software ([LICENSE](LICENSE)), and
one of several projects actvively sponsored by the ASWF
([Academy Software Foundation](https://www.aswf.io/)).

OpenColorIO was originally developed and made open source by
[Sony Pictures Imageworks](http://opensource.imageworks.com). The core design,
and the majority of OCIO 1.0 code was authored by Imageworks, who continue to
support and contribute to OCIO 2.0 development.

The design and development of OpenColorIO 2.0 is being led by Autodesk.
Autodesk submitted a proposal to revitalize the project in 2017, and have
authored the majority of OCIO 2.0 code in the years since.

Significant contributions have also been made by Industrial Light & Magic,
DNEG, and many individuals. See
