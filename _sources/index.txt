See the :ref:`userguide-tooloverview` for a brief explanation of the various parts of OpenColorIO, and how it could be used.

Mailing lists
*************

There are two mailing lists associated with OpenColorIO:

ocio-users_\ ``@googlegroups.com``
    For end-users (artists, often) of OCIO who have questions related to OCIO profile design, management, and workflow questions.

ocio-dev_\ ``@googlegroups.com``
    For users of OCIO tools, APIs, or people integrating OpenColorIO into other applications.  http://groups.google.com/group/ocio-dev


Downloading and building the code
*********************************

At present, there is not a separate precompiled or binary-only distribution of OpenColorIO (though we hope to eventually have one). For now, you'll have to check out and build the code yourself. 

Source code is available on Github at http://github.com/imageworks/OpenColorIO

Download a `.zip <http://github.com/imageworks/OpenColorIO/zipball/master>`_ or `.tar.gz <http://github.com/imageworks/OpenColorIO/tarball/master>`_ of the current state of the repository.

Note that OCIO profiles are required to do any 'real' work, and are available from the Downloads section of this site. Example images are also available.
