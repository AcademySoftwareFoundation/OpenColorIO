Mailing lists
*************

There are two mailing lists associated with OpenColorIO:

`ocio-users <http://groups.google.com/group/ocio-users>`__\ ``@googlegroups.com``
    For end users (artists, often) interested in OCIO profile design,
    facility color management, and workflow.

`ocio-dev <http://groups.google.com/group/ocio-dev>`__\ ``@googlegroups.com``
    For developers interested OCIO APIs, code integration, compilation, etc.

Using OpenColorIO
*****************
Most users will likely want to use the OpenColorIO that comes precompiled with
their applications.  See the :ref:`compatiblesoftware` for further details on
each application.

Note that OCIO configurations aren't required to do any 'real' work, and are
available separately on the :ref:`downloads` section of this site. Example
images are also available. For assistance customizing .ocio configurations,
contact the ocio-users email alias.

- Step 1:  set the OCIO environment-variable to /path/to/your/profile.ocio
- Step 2:  Launch supported application.

If you are on a platform that is not envvar friendly, most applications also
provide a menu option to select a different OCIO configuration after launch.

Please be sure to select a profile that matches your color workflow (VFX work
typically requires a different profile than animated features). If you need
assistance picking a profile, email ocio-users.
