   profile design, management, and workflow questions.

Downloading and building the code
*********************************
At present, there is not a separate precompiled or binary-only distribution of
|OpenColorIO| (though we hope to eventually have one). For now, you'll have to
check out and build the code yourself. See :ref:`building-from-source`.

Source code is available on Github at http://github.com/imageworks/OpenColorIO
Download a .zip or .tar.gz of the current state of the repository.

Note that |OCIO| profiles are required to do any 'real' work, and are available
from the Downloads section of this site. Example images are also available.
