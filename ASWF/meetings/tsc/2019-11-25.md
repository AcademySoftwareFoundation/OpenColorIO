# **OCIO TSC Meeting Notes**

* License for OpenColorIO-Configs
  - Annoying that official ACES config is in someone's personal fork, rather than the official repo

* Mission statement in repo
  - Michael has made a pull request as a starting point

* Automated GPU unit tests
  - There is an implementation on the ASWF lists, shouldn't be too hard to implement.
  - How are these funded? Free trial?

* v2 Working group meeting minutes
  - Should these be added to the OCIO repo? Yes!

* Use of environment variables in roles
  - should we be able to assign roles to environment variables?
 
* Colorspace aliases?
  - Is equality group the only way to define these?
  - Could YAML references work?
  - Might be nice to have an OCIO API way to define an alias
  - Can use roles :S

* get_colorspace_from_filename
  - Doug will post some issues to get feedback on how application authors should respond to 
    strict_parsing or errors finding colourspaces
