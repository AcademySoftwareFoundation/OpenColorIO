# **OCIO TSC Meeting Notes**

* Question for John re: DCO sign-off process
  Doug - What happens if the email that people are signing-off with is not the email of their employer (eg @autodesk.com).
  Lary - The CLA manager can log on and list all the emails that are associated with their employees.

  Only email addresses OK'd by the CLA manager (or domain, github user, etc) will be approved.
  
  DCO doesn't tell us /why/ a certain pull request was approved. So potentially a new feature request.
  John will confirm with the team as to how the DCO sign off will behave when a user has not completed the CLA process correctly, or is a new user.

* No updates on documentation refresh

* Hacktober fest tag work done by Patrick, looking for other volunteers to improve visibility

* No meeting next week (14/10/2019) due to thanksgiving in Canada
