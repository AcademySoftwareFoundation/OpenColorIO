# **OCIO TSC Meeting Notes**

* Move apps to OpenColorIO-Apps repo? Or a separate CMake project?
    - J: Yes, break them up.
    - Kevin: Split cmake instead of separate repo, without clear use case.
    - Michael: Creates version dependency
    - PAtrick: Strange for some apps to be out of repo
    - Sean: Good to distinguish between OCIO apps and utilities. Utils perf, checks, etc.
    - Patrick: ociodisplay just an example. Integration example.
    - Sean: Useful for debugging CPU/GPU renderer. Good for finding artifact cause.
    - Michael: Two builds or one with option
    - Mark: CMake doesnt do well to find internal depednency. Won't see the installed version of lib. Will try to rebuild and link against it. Benefit of separate repo is no cross-dependency between app and lib. Could be in one repo, and change dependencies of apps to depend on new installed target.
    - Michael: Can use CMake config to find library.
    - Mark: Needs to be done in two steps.
    - Patrick: Becomes a process for development. 
    - Mark: Not heard of anyone doing something else.
    - Michael: Could just split out oiio ones
    - Carol: Better to split them all out vs just some.
    - MArk: Could write Cmake find if it exists mechanism.
    - Sean: Why does ocioperf depend on OIIO. Can it just generate noise image? Worth looking into.
    - Caorl: Or back to what Michael was working on.
    - Mark B: Since half moving out, can move to use Imath to get half
    - Sean: ocioperf can use garbage data instead of images. Makes more sence for consistency. Can create all data types.
    - Patrick: Goal of tool to measure color transformation, not image IO. Could generate in memory image.
    - Doug: Performance changes with image because of cache usage. 
    - Sean: Clean to have utils be internal projects that dont depend on third-party libs, and apps to depend on third-party. Might invite dev of other apps too.
    - Patrick: ocioperf generate live image based on critereon, could be good work to do sooner.

* ASWF 2020 CCLA 2.1 transition:
    - ...
    - All sounds good.
    - Doug: Bringins us closer to original ASWF premise. Simplify contributions.
    - Patrick: No problem, but for four week no changes.

* Release discussion:
    - Thanks to Doug.
    - Ok with calling it done?
    - Doug: Think everything is ready. Delayed as long as we can. In CY2021 year now. It's time to move forward.
    - Carol: Good with it. Exciting!
    - Michael: Emily putting blog up and press release.
    - Kevin: Been using it prior to release.
    - Michael: Hooked up viewer.
    - Doug: Gotten fair amount of testing
  
* 2021 leadership thread:
    - ...

* GSoC:
    - Carol: Talking with Larry about internship with DNI. Half the hours and stipend this year. LArry sent email to tac. Coming up soon.  Are there smaller chunks of work? Details around AWS sponsored interships not finalizes yet, but got budget approved. Asked for three full time students. Sourcing diverse candidates. Dont have existing network, so more challenging to get going. Since not every project got DSoc students last summer, take into account for this year. Same mentor time, but possibly less student time. Could do docs.
    - Michael: Additional render path?
    - Patrick: Good but big. Maybe too much. A lot of work
    - Doug: Like idea of DNI project.
    - Carol: GSoC student can still work full time, but might be compressed timeline. For DNI, full summer, mimicing previous GSoC full time schedule.
    - Doug: Agreed that we would welcomd DNI intern? Also GSoC.
    - Michael: Probably only one.
    - doug: Hard since don't know how it's going to work out in advance.
    - Carol: Looking forward to seeing how it goes. Going to use LF platform for communication and progress tracking, etc. Have more control of process.
    - Doug: ASWF will know in advance.
    - Carol: 
    - Mark B: If mentoring is biggest expense, can mentor over both?
    - Carol: Double students could be more than double mentorship.
    - Sean: In either case it's a win for us. If choosing one would be more meaningful, more worthwhile.
    - Carol: Inclusion focused. More emphasis on introductions to the industry and how we use the project in jobs, etc. Mentorship can be shared by multiple people.
    - Sean: Good PR. Make sure they get best experience.
    - Doug: How many willing to be mentors? Will need to review applicants.
    - Patrick: Review proposals good test for mentoring too.
    - Doug: With DNI, not as random. 
    - Carol: All ASWF projects specialized. Hoping to source people from webinars. Career based webinars and software developer based webinars. Tie back into indistry with how things work. Why is OSS important for that.
    - Patrick: could also think about one or two lines about project to raise interest.

* UX Working Group:
    - ...
    - Mark: Meeting frequency?
    - Michael: Once or twice a month?
    - Doug: Every other week ideal. Important time to make sure rollout succesfull. 
    - Michael: Every other week starting in March.
    - Mark: Autodesk involvement? How involved
    - Doug: Patrick and I will stay involved. More features to do for 2.x release. Pace of work will slow, but will continue contributions. Been encouraging top see AD step forward and contribute. Hope others do too. Makes a differenc eot get people focused on it. Part of AWSF getting members to contribute. Been critical to have this group's participation. We've enjoyed the experience a lot.
    - Michael: FTE...
    - Patrick: 

* Items for next TSC meeting agenda:
    - GSoC ideas for next week. Willing mentors.
